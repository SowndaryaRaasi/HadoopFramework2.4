Explain the importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster
  NAME NODE:
    *It holds metadata i.e., information about data present in datanodes.
    * It consists of two important files:
                  1.fsimage:It contains All directory structure of HDFS
                                                 The blocks constituting a file.
                  2.edits: When any read or write operations take place, the directory structure gets modified.
                              These modifications are stored in the memory as well as in edits files .
   *Whenever data is to be retrieved form HDFS, a request is given to the name node.
     It gives the address of datanodes where the desired data is present.
  *Likewise when ever some data has to be inserted into it,the namenode tells the address of   data node which is free.
     It acts like an index holding all the information about all the data in the datanodes.
  *It also holds the information of the replicated blocks.
  *Also,when the namenode does not receive heart-beat signals from the data nodes at regular intervals,it considers them to be dead and 
   any further data is not allowed to be stored in them.
   That is, the name node has the information of the dead data nodes.
  *When the name node goes down ,the whole cluster goes down.Even though secondary namenode helps the name node in updating itself, 
   it cannot replace the namenode.
  *That is why , the name node has to be a very high end one.
